So here I am, on a Saturday afternoon, wanting to work on my site. The problemâ€¦is that I donâ€™t know quite how to do that yet. I recently got a job at T&S Web Design but I am still a noob at creating a web site. It was hard to catch on to the whole process to begin with but I think I am getting the hang of how they have it set up. My bosses are great and more than willing to help if I need it. I do like to try to figure stuff out on my own though so in most cases they are my last resort. Which lately I have been needing to go to my last resort a lot. Iâ€™m starting to get used to seeing HTML again but PHP is like a different language to me (haha, get it?â€¦), I have also never worked with CSS before so I am excited to learn all about both of those.

The first week went by really fast and I am really looking forward to starting my next week working there. I should find another job since I am only getting 20 hours a week, but I feel like I would completely hate it compared to T&S. Weâ€™ll see what God has in store for me, maybe something will turn up that I would also enjoy. Weâ€™ll see ðŸ™‚
