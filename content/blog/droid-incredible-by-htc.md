The news of Alltel in my area being bought out by Verizon had me quite excited when I had first heard about it. At that time the Google Nexus One was just about to be released and I didn‚Äôt know there was going to be a correlation. Soon after I had heard Alltel was getting bought out I also found out that the Google Nexus One would be coming to Verizon in the Spring of 2010! I was so excited and had my heart set on that phone as my next phone purchase, seeing as my Motorola RAZR has served me decently well for the past 2.5 years.

About a week ago I was kinda crushed when I found out that Verizon had bailed on the Google Nexus One. Since then I had just figured that I would stick with my RAZR until it died. That all changed yesterday when I discovered the DROID Incredible by HTC. I really like the way it looks and how big the screen is. It has a 8MP camera, comes with 8GB of internal storage and a microSD slot to increase that by either 16GB or 32GB‚Ä¶I have seen both in reviews and spec sheets. It has the 1 GHz Snapdragon processor which is one of the fastest on the market right now. It is priced at $199.99 if you purchase it with a new 2 year contract and a $29.99/month data plan is required.

So for as of right now the Incredible is my goal for a new phone this fall/winter. Hopefully I can find another job and save up enough money to pay for it after going on the cruise this summer! Money money money üôÅ  Just gotta keep workin.
