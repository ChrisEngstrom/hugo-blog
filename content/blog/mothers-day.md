I know I am late because Mother’s Day was this past Sunday. I didn’t actually forget, thank you very little, I just found a neat plugin that I wanted to try out called Smart Youtube that lets you embed youtube videos into your WordPress site really easily. I posted this video on my mom’s Facebook wall to remind her of what it is like when I am home. Here goes nothing…

Here is the code required just to link a video using the plugin. I had a hard time showing the code because the plugin reads it wherever you put it…so in case you can’t tell you simply just add a lower case v after the http in the normal address.

Just add &start=# where # is the second you want it to start at.

&start=36

Also if you want to do the HD version of the video from youtube, this plugin supports the 720p option. The reason why I didn’t us it on that video is because it didn’t have a 720p option.  So here is that…

For this you add an hd (for high definition) after the v. As far as I know I know it just automatically selects the highest quality available for that video but I may be wrong on that one.

There is also another option where you can play a play list:

This plugin could be extremely useful if you are using a lot of linked youtube videos on your website or blog. Check it out.
